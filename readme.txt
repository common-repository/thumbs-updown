Youtube-like rating system with thumbs up and thumbs down buttons. 

== Description ==
Rating plugin that automaticly adds rating panel below the content. It has red-green rating line, just like on youtube. You can change text of buttons or other options in plugin's settings.
Made using functions of 'Love It' (Pippin Williamson) plugin. It's temporary, I am going to rewrite it in the next version.
This is my very first plugin. So if you want to give a piece of advice - I would be very happy. 

== Installation ==

1. Extract and upload `thumbs-up-down` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
